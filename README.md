Team Trident - Final Project for INFO-I210

## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is about the moons that orbit planets in our Solar System. We will each choose two moons to research and then create a page on our site to share what we have learned. We have also included additional pages to cover Moon related topics like Conspiracies, Making your own Moons, and Moon media like songs and movies. We are looking to share information about moons and show how they impact popular culture.

We chose this because of our team name, Trident, and our love for all of the moons in our solar system!

### Key Takeaways

We are going to learn about MOONS! We aim to further our understanding of html and css by building an informative wedsite about the moons of our solar system. We are also learning about javascript and databases through a commenting system and other interactive elements on the Conspiracy and Make A Moon pages.

### Core Webpages

#### Home

- Includes a Map to all of the Moons

#### Moons

- Includes Core Information, Fun Facts, and a space to comment!

#### Conspiracies

#### Make A Moon

#### Lunar Tunes

#### Cosmic Cinema

### Design Choices

Each moon page will feature a photo of the moon with a brief description of the moon. We will use space themed colors for the background. There will also be a nav at the top to access the other pages, including a drop down list of moons.
The additional pages all feature a star themed background. We modeled out site after NASA moon pages (https://science.nasa.gov/mars/moons/phobos/) and the Space Jam (1996) website (https://www.spacejam.com/1996/).
