Team Trident - Final Project for INFO-I210

## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our project is about the moons that orbit planets in our Solar System. We will each choose two moons to research and then create a page on our site to share what we have learned. We chose this because of our team name, Trident, and our love for all of the moons in our solar system!

### Key Takeaways

We are going to learn about MOONS! We aim to further our understanding of html and css by building an informative wedbsite about the moons of our solar system.

### Core Webpages

List core webpages and briefly describe the page of them

### Design Choices

Each moon page will feature a photo of the moon with a brief description of the moon. We will use space themed colors for the background. There will also be a nav at the top to access the other pages.
