        <li>
          <p>we didn't go to the moon</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>the moon is made of cheese</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>the moon is flat, but the earth is round</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>the tides actually control the moon, not the other way around</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            we can't go to mars because our moon will be sad and Phobos will
            kill us
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            humanity will move to mars because the earth will be destroyed by
            global warming and then have to move back to earth millions of years
            later because mars will be destroyed by its moon
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>we are 70% water, so the moon controls us too</p>
        </li>
